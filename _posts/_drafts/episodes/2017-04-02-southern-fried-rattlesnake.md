## Like chicken but angrier

<p>
  After a heated stand-off with 5 rattle snakes on Thorngully Ranch, Elijah came out triumphant.  His smoking revolver had made quick work of 3 large rattlesnakes.  His dad vouching for a fairer contest made the most of a pitchfork snapping a few necks.

  Returning home triumphant, they were quickly skinned and dried.  In an effort not to waste a local organic delicatesse, there was no better way to consume them than to deep fry them !
